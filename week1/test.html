		<p>Espresso <em>(/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/, Italian: [esˈprɛsso])</em> is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a caffè latte, cappuccino, caffè macchiato, caffè mocha, flat white, or caffè Americano.</p>

		<p>A latte <em>(/ˈlɑːteɪ/ or /ˈlæteɪ/)</em> is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.

The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffè latte [kafˈfɛ ˈlatte], caffelatte [kaffeˈlatte] or caffellatte [kaffelˈlatte], which means "milk coffee". The word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography.</p>
